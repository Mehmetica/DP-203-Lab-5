# 🔍 Data Lake Analysis with Apache Spark on Azure Synapse

This project is based on the Microsoft Learn lab:  
**"Analyze data in a data lake with Apache Spark on Azure Synapse Analytics."**

It demonstrates how to explore, transform, and visualize big data using **Apache Spark** within **Azure Synapse**, working with files stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.

---

## 🚀 What I Did

- Created an **Apache Spark pool** in Azure Synapse
- Connected to **Data Lake Storage** and explored raw CSV data
- Used **PySpark** to read and transform the data
- Applied a defined **schema** for structured analysis
- Ran **Spark SQL queries** on the dataframe
- Visualized results using both **matplotlib** and built-in Synapse chart options
